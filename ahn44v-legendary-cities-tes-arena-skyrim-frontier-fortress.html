                            <p>What is one mod you really wish was updated? Mine is Legendary Cities Tes Arena Skyrim Frontier Fortress ( https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47989 (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47989) ) would love for the final version of all the cities to be released in the AIO patcher. My Honorable mention would be Sulfur and Fire Quest Mod by Mihail which is sadly hidden on his page. In no way do I mean to be ungrateful or impatient, just curious what mods people are waiting. This mod was made from Ro's Great Forest of Whiterun Hold. It is somewhere in between Forest Borealis which provides a much colder aesthetic, and Ro's Forest which appears as a lush, rainy forest. I created this mod to have inherent compatibility with every mod I could find that edits the tundra (even mods only available for Oldrim). Additionally, I removed all the added clutter (ie bushes, spriggans) keeping only the trees. As a final result, this valley forest shouldn't be any more performance. Please refrain from commenting a mod that's already been listed, but feel free to reply to any comments with your opinion! Thank you Whiterun Forest Borealis (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11343) \- I plan to remake the mod with as little performance impact as possible as I feel the performance hit currently is unacceptable. If you have ever used Ro's Great Forest of Whiterun Hold (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3212/?tab=description), then you've. 
Hey guys. I'm having trouble with constant CTDs. They just started recently so I'm not sure what is going on. I've got LOOT managing my load order and I've made all the necessary changes to my .inis and whatnot. I have the legendary edition Also my specs are these NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M 4 GB GDDR5 Intel Core i7 6700HQ (2.60 GHz) 8 GB Memory 1 TB HDD Here is my mod list if anyone is interested/able to help. Thanks! Mod List: • 360 Walk and Run Plus • A Matter of Time • Adal Matar THIS IS FOR SSE I'M OM MOBILE. Hey guys, I have added both mods into my load order and I've noticed that children have black faces no matter the order I put them. I was also searchung if there's any compability patch between both, but the only thing I found was a Nexus forum comment in Oldrim Tes Arena page that stated there was no need for a patch for these mods. My current order is RSChildren.esm Tes Arena.esps (3 single modules) RSChildren.esp Previously, the TeS Arena modules were below. Whenever I play, every few minutes I CTD and it has gotten really annoying. It's the worst when I'm in windhelm and renders it basically unplayable because of crashing every 5 seconds.

As soon as I release the spell, CTD. I can cast Bound Battleaxe just fine. Bound Sword: Crashtown. I loaded up a test profile with just Alternate Start, Aequinoctium, Sounds of Skyrim, and USSEP. It works fine there. But something in the mod list that I'm trying to make work is bugging it up, I guess. Please have a look and let me know if you have any idea what might be causing the CTD. I appreciate the help! Here is my mod list: I made it to a city added by “Legendary Cities - TES Arena - Skyrim Frontier Fortress” and found everything “doubled” (two of every character, two gates on top of each other, etc). Other cities added by the mod were the same. According to posts on the mod page, this is a known issue others have experienced due to error on the installer created by the modder, so I can’t imagine it being due to other mods/PC issues. (The most recent post is mine https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/. Super unusual crash, and its always the same thing so I am thinking its a combat or AI mod, or a script problem, can someone help me out?

I posted a general thread about this the other day, asking, generally, what order it makes sense to merge things in. I did get some helpful advice, but I'm having trouble untangling anything from all its dependencies and dependants. For example, when I though "oh, I'll start with Legacy of the Dragonborn, because it has loads of patches", I ended up with 160 or so plugins active when I had finished activating everything which either adds on to it or is patched by it. This game was not meant. 
I'm trying to make my skyrim play more like zelda botw, aka no health regen.

I've been trying to make a mod order that changes the civilized parts of Skyrim drastically, with mods like JK's Skyrim, the Dawn of Skyrim series, Holds Overhaul (just the new locations), Expanded Towns And Cities (just the towns), Whiterun Outskirts Market, Ebonvale, Frontier Fortress, and various mods that target Solitude specifically. (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60430/) Naturally I'm here because I'm having difficulty getting these to work, with CTDs on startup I was hoping someone who'd used both: The Elder Scrolls Online Imports ( ) and Legendary Cities - Tes Arena - Skyrim Frontier Fortress ( ) Might be able to tell me if they make Skyrim too crowded? I love the idea of making Skryim more lore friendly, with adding in the ruins or remainders of towns that we saw in Arena, while adding in the new locations ESO added (Which we have been told is cannon, actually. Legendary Cities - Tes Arena - Skyrim Frontier Fortress by Jabr is now available for SSE! Currently, only one city is being added, with the mod author planning to add the other cities weekly and eventually releasing the AIO version after. Go check the mod out , imo one of the best mods that add cities and towns. www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/318/. According to both lore, Tamriel maps and reputation, Skyrim is a brutal unforgiving landscape covered in snow. When looking around you, you’d be seeing pines, castles, pines (and perhaps a fearless Nord beating the living hell out of a bear). This mod list contains both mods that makes Skyrim into an immersive winter wonderland, and hopefully you’ll find some underrated mods which really help immersion. Enjoy and don’t hesitate to add your own recommendations! (These are obviously So i'm currently looking for mods that make Skyrim look more like it is depicted in the lore/in-game texts and books/ etc. So far i've gotten: Legendary Cities - Tes Arena - Skyrim Frontier Fortress: This mod adds ten historical cities to Skyrim present in TES:Arena. ( Hjaalmarch Redux: Makes Hjaalmarch the marsh it's supposed. I just started playing Skyrim a few days ago. I decided to start installing some mods. Everything was good until yesterday. I'm out in the wilderness somewhere and as I start to wander around, it eventually crashes. I need to get back to a certain area to do a quest but no matter how I try to get there, it keeps crashing. I'm new to this and never installed mods on a game before so I'm learning. I use NMM and MO, but prefer NMM. Yes, I use LOOT too and can't find any errors. If anyone So I've promised myself if I could get this last batch of mods integrated into my game successfully, I would stop all my tweaking, fiddling, and testing and just play the game uninterrupted finally. However, after this final set of mods I've noticed my CTDs have gone from once every hour or two, to every 5~15 minutes, which I can no longer ignore. The CTDs don't appear to follow a set pattern usually; typically I'm just walking around, and then I get a CTD without any special messagebox 
Two mods that were essential for my Oldrim playthroughs were Dawn of Skyrim ( and Expanded Towns and Cities ( and I always wanted to try Legendary Cities - Tes Arena - Skyrim Frontier Fortress ( Has anyone else tried converting these to the Special Edition and can vouch whether How does a player get regular stone, not quarried stone? I realized I could get quarried stone by using the pickaxe and repeatedly hitting regular stones out in the wilderness, but I need regular stones to do something and so far, I've only got 10 stones and that was when I purchased them from a store. I don't want to have to buy stones, if I can get them myself. I've tried Google searches but just have found countless pages about quarried stone, which I already know how to get. Screenshots. I've been having fairly frequent crashes and was wondering if it was because of some mod I'm using that is notoriously unstable or two mods that don't work well together. I'd appreciate any help from more experienced modders. (Sorry the mod list is upside down, it's because that's how mod organizer lists them in their text file) +Follower Compatibility +Alternate Start - Live Another Life +Legacy of the Dragonborn Patcher +Moon and Star +Legacy of the Dragonborn V17 Core Package +Inte. As the title says, I'm getting an increasing number of CTDs in the game (not at the splash screen or while loading a save) and can't really discern a pattern to them. Generally the CTDs will happen while I'm loading into an exterior cell or while I'm simply walking around. They'll happen within a city (Whiterun is the only interior cell city I've been to so far) or out on the road in Falkreath - location doesn't seem to matter. I appreciate any insight anyone may have.
